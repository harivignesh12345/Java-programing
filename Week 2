1)Consider the following sequence:

1st term: 1

2nd term: 1 2 1

3rd term: 1 2 1 3 1 2 1

4th term: 1 2 1 3 1 2 1 4 1 2 1 3 1 2 1

And so on. Write a program that takes as parameter an integer n and prints the nth terms of this sequence.

Example Input:

1

Output:

1

Example Input:

4

Output:

1 2 1 3 1 2 1 4 1 2 1 3 1 2 1
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SequenceGenerator {

    // Function to generate the nth term of the sequence
    public static String generateTerm(int n) {
        // Start with the first term
        String term = "1";

        // Generate the sequence up to the nth term
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            StringBuilder newTerm = new StringBuilder();
            
            // Append current term with number i between characters with spaces
            newTerm.append(term);
            newTerm.append(" ");
            newTerm.append(i);
            newTerm.append(" ");
            newTerm.append(term);
            
            // Convert the new term back to string for the next iteration
            term = newTerm.toString();
        }

        return term;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Input: Read the integer n
        int n = sc.nextInt();

        // Output the nth term of the sequence
        System.out.println(generateTerm(n));
        
        sc.close();
    }

2)You and your friend are movie fans and want to predict if the movie is going to be a hit!

The movie’s success formula depends on 2 parameters:

the acting power of the actor (range 0 to 10)

the critic’s rating of the movie (range 0 to 10)

The movie is a hit if the acting power is excellent (more than 8) or the rating is excellent (more than 8). This holds true except if either the acting power is poor (less than 2) or rating is poor (less than 2), then the movie is a flop. Otherwise the movie is average.

Write a program that takes 2 integers:

the first integer is the acting power

second integer is the critic’s rating.

You have to print Yes if the movie is a hit, Maybe if the movie is average and No if the movie is flop.

Example input:

9 5

Output:

Yes

Example input:

1 9

Output:

No

Example input:

6 4

Output:

Maybe
import java.util.Scanner;

public class MoviePrediction {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

       
        int actingPower = sc.nextInt();
        int criticRating = sc.nextInt();

        
        if (actingPower < 2 || criticRating < 2) {
            
            System.out.println("No");
        } else if (actingPower > 8 || criticRating > 8) {
            
            System.out.println("Yes");
        } else {
           
            System.out.println("Maybe");
        }
        
        sc.close();
    }
}

3)Write a program that takes as parameter an integer n.

You have to print the number of zeros at the end of the factorial of n.

For example, 3! = 6. The number of zeros are 0. 5! = 120. The number of zeros at the end are 1.

Note: n! < 10^5

Example Input:

3

Output:

0

Example Input:

60

Output:

Example Input:

100

Output:

Example Input:

        for (int i = 5; n / i >= 1; i *= 5) {
            count += n / i;
        }
        
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        
        int n = sc.nextInt();

    }
