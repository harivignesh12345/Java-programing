Java HashSet class implements the Set interface, backed by a hash table which is actually a HashMap instance.

No guarantee is made as to the iteration order of the hash sets which means that the class does not guarantee the constant order of elements over time.

This class permits the null element.

 The class also offers constant time performance for the basic operations like add, remove, contains, and size assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly among the buckets.

Java HashSet Features
A few important features of HashSet are mentioned below:

Implements Set Interface.
The underlying data structure for HashSet is Hashtable.
As it implements the Set Interface, duplicate values are not allowed.
Objects that you insert in HashSet are not guaranteed to be inserted in the same order. Objects are inserted based on their hash code.
NULL elements are allowed in HashSet.
HashSet also implements Serializable and Cloneable interfaces.
public class HashSet<E> extends AbstractSet<E> implements Set<E>, Cloneable, Serializable

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            numbers.add(sc.nextInt());

        int skey = sc.nextInt();

        // Show which numbers between 1 and 10 are in the set
        if (numbers.contains(skey)) {
            System.out.println(skey + " was found in the set.");
        } else {
            System.out.println(skey + " was not found in the set.");
        }
    }

Java HashMap Methods

containsKey() Indicate if an entry with the specified key exists in the map

containsValue() Indicate if an entry with the specified value exists in the map

putIfAbsent() Write an entry into the map but only if an entry with the same key does not already exist

remove() Remove an entry from the map

replace()   Write to an entry in the map only if it exists

size()   Return the number of entries in the map

Your task is to fill the incomplete code to get desired output
