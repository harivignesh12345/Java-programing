RBI issues all national banks to collect interest on all customer loans.

Create an RBI interface with a variable  String parentBank="RBI" and abstract method rateOfInterest().

RBI interface has two more methods default and static method.

default void policyNote() {

System.out.println("RBI has a new Policy issued in 2023.");

}

static void regulations(){

System.out.println("RBI has  updated new regulations on 2024.");

}

Create two subclasses SBI and Karur which implements the RBI interface.

Provide the necessary code for the abstract method in two sub-classes. 

Sample Input/Output:

RBI has a new Policy issued in 2023
RBI has updated new regulations in 2024.
SBI rate of interest: 7.6 per annum.
Karur rate of interest: 7.4 per annum.

interface RBI {
    // Variable
    String parentBank = "RBI";

    // Abstract Method
    double rateOfInterest();

    // Default Method
    default void policyNote() {
        System.out.println("RBI has a new Policy issued in 2023");
    }

    // Static Method
    static void regulations() {
        System.out.println("RBI has updated new regulations in 2024.");
    }
}

// SBI class implementing RBI interface
class SBI implements RBI {
    // Overriding the abstract method
    @Override
    public double rateOfInterest() {
        return 7.6;
    }
}

// Karur class implementing RBI interface
class Karur implements RBI {
    // Overriding the abstract method
    @Override
    public double rateOfInterest() {
        return 7.4;
    }
}

// Main class to test the program
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating objects of SBI and Karur
        SBI sbi = new SBI();
        Karur karur = new Karur();

        // Calling default method from SBI
        sbi.policyNote();

        // Calling static method from RBI
        RBI.regulations();

        // Displaying rate of interest
        System.out.println("SBI rate of interest: " + sbi.rateOfInterest() + " per annum.");
        System.out.println("Karur rate of interest: " + karur.rateOfInterest() + " per annum.");
    }

Create interfaces shown below. 

 interface Sports {
public void setHomeTeam(String name);
public void setVisitingTeam(String name); 
}
 interface Football extends Sports {
public void homeTeamScored(int points);
public void visitingTeamScored(int points);}

create an interface Playable with a method play() that takes no arguments and returns void. Create three classes Football, Volleyball, and Basketball that implement the Playable interface and override the play() method to play the respective sports.

interface Playable {
    void play();
}

class Football implements Playable {
    String name;
    public Football(String name){
        this.name=name;
    }
  public void play() {
    System.out.println(name+" is Playing football");
   }
}

Similarly, create Volleyball and Basketball classes.

Sample output:

Sadhvin is Playing football
Sanjay is Playing volleyball
Sruthi is Playing basketball
import java.util.Scanner;

// Playable Interface
interface Playable {
    void play();
}

// Football class implementing Playable
class Football implements Playable {
    String name;
    
    public Football(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public void play() {
        System.out.println(name + " is Playing football");
    }
}

// Volleyball class implementing Playable
class Volleyball implements Playable {
    String name;
    
    public Volleyball(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public void play() {
        System.out.println(name + " is Playing volleyball");
    }
}

// Basketball class implementing Playable
class Basketball implements Playable {
    String name;
    
    public Basketball(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public void play() {
        System.out.println(name + " is Playing basketball");
    }
}

// Main class to test the program
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using Scanner to get input dynamically
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Getting names of the players from input
        String footballPlayerName = scanner.nextLine();
        String volleyballPlayerName = scanner.nextLine();
        String basketballPlayerName = scanner.nextLine();

        // Creating objects with input names
        Football footballPlayer = new Football(footballPlayerName);
        Volleyball volleyballPlayer = new Volleyball(volleyballPlayerName);
        Basketball basketballPlayer = new Basketball(basketballPlayerName);

        // Calling play method for each player
        footballPlayer.play();
        volleyballPlayer.play();
        basketballPlayer.play();

        // Closing scanner to avoid resource leaks
        scanner.close();
